# docker-template

I compiled this template from several scripts from the web to make my daily work with Docker more easy.

## Getting Started

First, be sure to copy the settings from the `config.env.example` files. Run `make help` to see the available commands.

Then adapt the Dockerfile matching your needs and run `make image && make run`.
